    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      I am a NEBOSH IGC certified Safety professional seeking an entry-level opportunity in the Oman / Gulf region, where strong safety standards, regulatory compliance, and proactive risk management are highly valued. I have a solid understanding of occupational health and safety principles, including hazard identification, risk assessment, incident reporting, and permit-to-work systems, aligned with international best practices.

As a fresher, I bring a strong learning mindset, discipline, and commitment to safety culture, with the ability to follow site safety procedures and support HSE teams in daily operations. I am familiar with construction and industrial safety requirements, use of personal protective equipment (PPE), toolbox talks, safety inspections, and maintaining HSE documentation in line with company and client requirements.

I am particularly interested in working within construction, oil & gas, manufacturing, and industrial projects across Oman and the wider GCC, where safety performance is a critical priority. I am comfortable working in multicultural environments, following supervisor instructions, and adapting to site-specific safety rules and standards.

My long-term goal is to grow as a Safety Officer in the Gulf region by gaining practical site experience, expanding my technical knowledge, and contributing positively to organizations committed to protecting people, property, and the environment.
